# Learning C

This is a repository where I am learning how to program in C for myself and other beginners

> [!WARNING]
> I am in no way an expert in C programming. You will be learning along with me. At the time of writing this I have absolutely no idea how to robustly/correctly write C code. Do not think that everything here is best practice because I assure it is probably not.

Have fun and try to learn something!

> [!NOTE]
> In this repository all the commands will be using using the gcc compiler and working in a linux system.
